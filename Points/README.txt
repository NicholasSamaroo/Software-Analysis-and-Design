You will use this exact Makefile for your Homework 1.
Failure to do so will result in deduction of points.

To compile on terminal type
  make clean
  make all

To delete executables and object file type
  make clean

To run:

./test_points2

^^In that case you will provide input from standard input.

To run with a given file that is redirected to standard input:

./test_points2 < test_input_file.txt


i. All parts of the assignment were completed
ii. This program does not have any bugs
iii. The way I tested my program to see if it ran in linux is to go into my Documents folder on my linux account.
     I created my own directory and put the Makfile test_input_file.txt points2.h test_points2.cc and the expected output
     Doing make clean and then make all creates an executable and then I ran the executable doing ./test_points2 < test_input_file.txt
     which then produced my output.
